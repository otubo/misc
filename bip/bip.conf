# Configuration example with one user who connects to two irc networks

#  - define the connections
#  - chose and setup a different login for each connection
# on your irc client:
#  - Use the multi server feature of your client, the server beeing each time
#    the server where bip is running. In your client setup server password to:
#      username:password:connectionname
#  - do not store the password in clear here, use the bipmkpw util to generate
# a hash

	# - "ca" to do a complete certificate chain checking with the objects
	# in the store below (you have to put in it every cert, CRL, up to the
	# root CA). You have to build your store manually, so you may prefer
